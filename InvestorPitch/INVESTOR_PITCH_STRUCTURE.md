### Slide 1: Opening Hook (30 seconds)
**Visual**: Split screen - antiquated golf course office vs modern Apple Watch
**Headline**: "Golf is an $84 Billion Industry Stuck in the 1990s"

### Slide 2: The Problem (1 minute)
**Visual**: Infographic showing golf course inefficiencies

**Script**:
*"Golf courses are hemorrhaging money due to antiquated systems. Members expect Uber-level convenience but get 1990s technology. Course operators work 60+ hour weeks on manual processes that should be automated."*

### Slide 3: The Solution (1 minute)
**Visual**: Clean product screenshots showing dashboard + mobile app
**Headline**: "Complete White Label Platform That Transforms Any Golf Course"

**Key Features**:

### Slide 4: Market Opportunity (1 minute)
**Visual**: Market size pyramid with TAM/SAM/SOM breakdown
**Numbers**:

- **SAM**: $900M digital transformation opportunity  
- **SOM**: $54M ARR potential at 10% US market penetration

**Script**:
*"We're targeting 15,000 golf courses in the US alone. At just $300 per month - less than one employee's daily wage - we have a $54 million annual revenue opportunity. Internationally, this scales to over $100 million."*

### Slide 5: Business Model (1 minute)
**Visual**: Revenue stream waterfall chart
**Primary Streams**:
- **White Label Platform**: $99-599/month recurring
- **Enterprise Setup**: $1,000-2,500 one-time fees
- **API Monetization**: Growing developer ecosystem
- **Premium Features**: Custom development and consulting

**Script**:
*"Our primary revenue is white label SaaS subscriptions. We also capture setup fees for enterprise clients and have a growing API business. The beauty is that each course brings their own customers and data - no cold start problem."*

### Slide 6: Traction & Demo (3 minutes)
**Visual**: Live product demonstration
**Show in Order**:
1. **Golf course dashboard** with real data and analytics
2. **Mobile app experience** including Apple Watch
3. **White label theming** showing course customization

### Slide 7: Competitive Landscape (1 minute)
**Visual**: Competitive positioning matrix
**Key Differentiators**:
- **Only white label platform** - competitors lock courses into their brand
- **Apple Watch integration** - no competitor offers this
- **Complete infrastructure** - others are point solutions
- **No commission model** - courses keep 100% of revenue

**Script**:
*"We're not competing with booking platforms like TeeOff that take 10-15% commissions. We're not another course management system that locks courses into our brand. We're the only platform that gives courses complete ownership of their digital experience."*

### Slide 8: Go-to-Market Strategy (1 minute)
**Visual**: Funnel showing customer acquisition strategy
**Phase 1**: Pilot program with 3-5 diverse courses
**Phase 2**: Scale through golf management companies
**Phase 3**: Enterprise golf chains and corporate programs

### Slide 9: Team & Execution (1 minute)
**Visual**: Team photos with key accomplishments
**Key Points**:
- **Technical infrastructure complete** - production ready today

**Script**:
*"We have a clear path to $6 million ARR in three years with healthy SaaS margins. Our customer acquisition cost is low because golf is a relationship-driven industry, and our lifetime value is high because switching costs increase over time."*

### Slide 11: Investment Ask (30 seconds)
**Visual**: Use of funds pie chart
**Ask**: $2M Seed Round
**Use of Funds**:
- 40% Sales & Marketing

## üîç Common Investor Questions & Answers

### "How big is the market really?"
**Answer**: "15,000 golf courses in the US spending an average of $50,000+ annually on technology and operations. At just $3,600 per year, we're capturing a fraction of existing spend while delivering 10x the value. Internationally, this scales to 40,000+ courses."

### "What's your customer acquisition strategy?"
**Answer**: "Golf is relationship-driven. We start with pilot programs, prove ROI, then scale through golf management companies that operate 50+ courses each. One enterprise relationship can deploy to hundreds of courses simultaneously."

### "How do you compete with established players?"
**Answer**: "We don't compete - we enable. Existing players either take commissions (we don't) or force courses into their brand (we provide white label). We're the only platform that gives courses complete ownership of their digital experience."

### "What's your moat?"
**Answer**: "Network effects, technical complexity, and switching costs. Each course adds value to our platform. Our enterprise infrastructure takes years to replicate. Once deployed, courses build their member experience on our platform - high switching costs."

### "How do you handle seasonality?"
**Answer**: "Golf has geographic seasonality but global diversification solves this. Northern courses are quiet while southern courses peak. Our SaaS model provides predictable revenue regardless of seasonal booking patterns."
