## **Appendix: Key Questions & Answers**

### **Q: How do you compete with free golf apps?**
**A:** We're not competing on price - we're creating a new category. Golfers pay $50+ for a round; $10/month for premium social features is reasonable. Our B2B revenue doesn't depend on golfer payments.

### **Q: What if a big company copies your API?**
**A:** Network effects and data moat protect us. More users = better data = more valuable API. Plus, golf-specific expertise takes years to develop.

### **Q: How do you scale customer acquisition?**
**A:** Viral mechanics in tournaments, partnership with golf courses for distribution, and high LTV justifies significant marketing spend.

### **Q: What about seasonality in golf?**
**A:** Northern seasonality offset by southern markets, indoor simulators, and global expansion. API revenue is less seasonal.
