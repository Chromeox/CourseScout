# ðŸ”„ Solving the API Data Chicken-and-Egg Problem

## The Core Challenge

**The Question**: "How do you make money from an API if you have no data?"

**The Reality**: This is the classic two-sided marketplace problem - you need data to attract developers, but you need developers to justify collecting data.
