# ðŸ”— API Developer Platform Pitch

## Executive Summary
**"We're Building the Stripe for Golf"**

GolfFinderSwiftUI provides the unified API and infrastructure that golf app developers need to build amazing experiences without rebuilding core golf functionality.

---

## The Developer Problem We Solve

### Current Golf App Development Pain Points
1. **No unified golf course API** - developers build course integrations one by one
2. **Authentication complexity** - each course has different login systems
3. **Payment processing** - golf-specific needs (deposits, cancellations, group bookings)
4. **Data standardization** - every course structures data differently
5. **Infrastructure costs** - small teams can't afford enterprise-grade systems

### Our Solution: Golf Infrastructure as a Service
- **One API** connects to 100+ golf courses
- **Unified authentication** across all courses
- **Standardized data models** for courses, bookings, members
- **Built-in payment processing** with golf-specific flows
- **Enterprise infrastructure** at startup-friendly pricing
