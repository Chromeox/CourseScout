## 🎵 Premium Haptic Feedback System

One of the standout features is the golf-specific haptic feedback system:

```swift
// Example: Score entry haptic feedback
await hapticService.provideScoreEntryHaptic(scoreType: .birdie)

// Tee-off haptic with Apple Watch coordination
await hapticService.provideTeeOffHaptic()

// Leaderboard position change feedback
await hapticService.provideLeaderboardUpdateHaptic(position: .first)
```
