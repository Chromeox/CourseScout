#### **Risk 2: Testing Infrastructure Delays**
**Impact**: Medium - Could delay final validation and deployment  
**Mitigation**:
- Window 3 sets up basic CI/CD pipeline on Day 1
- Incremental testing throughout development, not just at end
- Parallel test development alongside feature development

#### **Risk 3: Performance Integration Issues**
**Impact**: Medium - Real-time features might not meet performance requirements  
**Mitigation**:
