Fellow golfers,

As someone who's been frustrated with the current golf app landscape, I've been working on something different. GolfFinder combines course discovery, booking, and game tracking in a way that actually makes sense.

We're looking for experienced golfers to beta test before our public launch. This isn't just "another booking app" - we've built features specifically based on what golfers told us was missing.

Beta Program Benefits:
- Free Premium subscription (normally $9.99/mo)
- Direct influence on final features
- Exclusive beta tester community
- 50% discount on first year post-launch

What we need from testers:
- Regular golfers (1+ rounds/month)
- iPhone users (iOS 16+)
- Honest feedback via surveys
- 2-3 weeks of testing commitment

The app launches publicly in September, so this is your chance to help shape the final product and get premium features free.

If you're interested, shoot me a PM with your handicap and how often you play. Priority goes to active community members!

Thanks,
[Your name]
